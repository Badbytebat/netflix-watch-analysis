# Netflix Watch Time Analysis

This is a personal data analysis project using my Netflix viewing history.  
I extracted viewing patterns based on time, date, and content â€” and visualized them using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and transformed raw Netflix CSV data
- Extracted features: date, hour, weekday, month, year
- Visualized:
  - Top 10 watched titles
  - Daily viewing trend
  - Viewing patterns by hour & day
  - Heatmap of binge habits

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub
